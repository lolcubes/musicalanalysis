# Beats in Bytes - Bash Scripts for Musical Analysis

This repository contains many scripts in the .sh format written specifically for musical analysis. All of them are written to be run on the kern file format, which allows music to be written as text. This file format is originally from the Humdrum Toolkit. Some scripts in this repository also utilize Humdrum commands. To learn more about Humdrum and kern, go to https://humdrum.org.
